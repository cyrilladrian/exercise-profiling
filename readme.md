### Question 1
The difference is JMeter simulates many user that fetch the application, while the profiler records how much time for the program to run

### Question 2
It helps where to find the function that takes up the most time; so that I can refactor it to optimize the code. 
### Question 3
It is effective since it can identify all the resource needed to run a particular program. 
### Question 4
The challenges is in the refactoring process and try to find another way to make the code better without tampering to its functionality.
### Question 5
The main benefit of the Java Profiling is to get a guide on where to start when refactoring the project and the code
### Question 6
I'd begin by examining both the JMeter and IntelliJ profilers to identify any disparities. If I observe similarities in throughput times, I'd prioritize addressing those issues first. Subsequently, I'd delve deeper into the inconsistencies to pinpoint any weaknesses.

### Question 7
I use my knowledge from the Data Structure and Algorithm class. Knowledge regarding the retrieving time complexities, and I try to find another alternative to the current algorithm.
